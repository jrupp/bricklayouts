# Copilot Agent Setup Steps
# This file defines the setup steps that should be run when a Copilot Agent
# starts working on this repository. These steps ensure that the agent has
# everything it needs to successfully run tests and work with the codebase.

steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
    
  - name: Patch jasmine-browser-runner for WebGL support
    run: node scripts/patch-jasmine-webdriver.js
    
  - name: Make selenium-manager wrapper executable
    run: chmod +x .github/selenium-manager-offline.sh

# Note: Tests should be run with the SE_MANAGER_PATH environment variable
# set in the command itself. See .github/copilot-instructions.md for the
# correct test command to use.
