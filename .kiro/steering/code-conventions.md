# Code Conventions

Currently, there are no automated linting tools configured.
This project wants to follow the AirBNB JavaScript style guide as closely as possible, but has not implemented that in all files yet. For all new code, follow the AirBNB style guide as closely as possible. Especially pay attention to:
- 2 space indentation
- Use of semicolons
- Blank lines should not have spaces or tabs
